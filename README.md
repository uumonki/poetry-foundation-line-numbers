# Poem Line Numbers
 A Chrome Extension to automatically add line numbers to Poetry Foundation poems.
 
 To install, go to Extensions (chrome://extensions/), enable Developer Mode, Load Unpacked, and select the PoetryLineNumbers folder. Disable Developer Mode, and you're good to go!
 
 Assumes that a completely bold line following an empty line is a header, and consequently ignores the line in numbering. Definitely not fool-proof, especially for contemporary poetry, so improvement suggestions are welcome.
 
 ### Improvements needed
 * Interface for extension pop-up.
